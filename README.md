# Solarized Coda for TextMate

> A `.tmTheme` based on <https://github.com/bobthecow/solarized-seestyle>.

## Completeness

This is absolutely work in progress and does not have a lot definitions in it - but it works quite well for `PHP` and `HTML`.

If you have ideas to improve the theme, don't hesitate to send a Pull Request. :)
